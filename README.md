- In ToDoComponent, implement the following functionality:
  <!-- - There should be two text input fields, one dropdown input field (Hint: use <select> and <option>), and a button.
  - Every input field should store its current value in a useState variable. The input field should also receive its current value from the variable in useState, i.e. it should be a controlled component: -->
    <!-- - <input type="text" value={title} onChange={(event)=>{
      const newTitle = event.target.value
      setTitle(title)
      }}>
  
  - The first text input field should set a state variable called title.
  
  - The second text input field should set a state variable called description. -->

  <!-- - The dropdown field should have 3 values "low", "medium" and "high" and should set a state variable called importance. -->

  - The button should say submit and onClick, it should push a new object into a state variable called toDoList with the current values inputted by the user. E.G. If I type a title of "New Todo", a description of "My new todo", select an importance of "medium", and press submit, the state variable toDoList should look like this:
    - [{
      title: "New Todo",
      description: "My new Todo",
      importance: "medium"
      }]
      
  - Finally, render the list of todo's stored in toDoList to the page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
